# Movie Recommendation System
#Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques. It leverages the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings.

#Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user interaction data.
Matrix Factorization: Uses SVD to predict ratings and generate recommendations.
Setup
Install Dependencies: Make sure to install the required Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and scikit-surprise.

Prepare Datasets: Ensure that you have the ratings.csv and movies.csv files. The ratings.csv should include user ratings, while the movies.csv should include movie metadata.

#Usage
Load Data: Merge and prepare the datasets for analysis.

Train the Model: Split the data into training and test sets, then train the SVD model on the training data.

Evaluate the Model: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

Get Recommendations: Generate movie recommendations for users based on the trained model.

#Troubleshooting
Memory Issues: Use a subset of the data if the full dataset is too large.
Key Errors: Verify that column names in your datasets match the expected names.
Library Issues: Ensure that all required libraries are correctly installed and up-to-date.
